Use sap.ui.define for controllers and all other JavaScript modules to define a global namespace.
 With the namespace, the object can be addressed throughout the application.

Use sap.ui.require for asynchronously loading dependencies but without declaring a namespace,
 for example code that is directly executed and is not referenced in other places.

The helper method sap.ui.core.ComponentContainer instantiates the component by searching for 
 a Component.js file in the namespace that is passed in as an argument. 

All application-specific configuration settings will now further be put in a separate descriptor
 file called manifest.json. This clearly separates the application coding from the configuration
 settings and makes our app even more flexible. For example, all SAP Fiori applications are
 realized as components and come with a descriptor file in order to be hosted in the
 SAP Fiori launchpad.

The SAP Fiori launchpad acts as an application container and instantiates the app 
 without having a local HTML file for the bootstrap. Instead, the descriptor 
 file will be parsed and the component is loaded into the current HTML page. 
 This allows several apps to be displayed in the same context. Each app can define 
 local settings, such as language properties, supported devices, and more. 
 And we can also use the descriptor file to load additional resources and instantiate 
 models like our i18n resource bundle.
