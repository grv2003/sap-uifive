with sap fiori all application within fiori are realized as components & 
they come with a descriptor file. So that they can be hosted within 
the fiori launchpad itself, so fiori launchpad access(sort of container)
and instantiates the app without having a local html file for all the 
bootstrapping stuff & so instead the descriptor file is passed & the 
component is loaded into the current html page. So this allows 
several apps to be displayed on the same context & each app can define
local settings.
We can also use descriptor file to load additional resources and instantiates models
